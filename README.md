# Quora_Question_Pair_Similarity

This is a problem on kaggle hosted by Quora to detect similarity between two questions given which are actually posted originally on Quora. They have asked for automating this with the help of ML and DL approaches. I have uploaded the ML approaches which I have followed with their first cut results. I would add DL approaches with the results along with the improvements on the first cut ML solutions provided.
